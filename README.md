# yt-ad-autoskipper-safari
A Safari extension that automates skipping ad on Youtube. This is not an ad blocker, it just automates the process of clicking on the "Skip Ad" button on Youtube.

This plugin was created as a safari version of the [squgeim](https://github.com/squgeim)/**[yt-ad-autoskipper](https://github.com/squgeim/yt-ad-autoskipper)** plugin.
