# yt-ad-autoskipper-safari
A Safari extension that automates skipping ad on Youtube. This is not an ad blocker, it just automates the process of clicking on the "Skip Ad" button on Youtube.

This extension was created as a safari version of the [squgeim](https://github.com/squgeim)/**[yt-ad-autoskipper](https://github.com/squgeim/yt-ad-autoskipper)** extension.  

## Try This Extension
- Download [Latest Preview](https://github.com/ohanedan/yt-ad-autoskipper-safari/releases/latest)
- Turn on developer mode on Safari.
- Open "Allow unsigned extensions" option in developer menu.
- Put the application in the Applications folder and run(You may need to allow it from the "security & privacy" section in the System Preferences).
- Activate this extension from the safari settings menu.

### When you use unsigned build, safari stops the extension after a while for security reasons. You can use extension without any problems by downloading [archive build](https://github.com/ohanedan/yt-ad-autoskipper-safari/releases/download/v1.0/Youtube.Ad.Auto.Skipper.xcarchive.zip) and signing with your personal development certificate.
